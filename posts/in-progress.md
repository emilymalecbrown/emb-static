### Choosing a theming / component library

I’ve used rebass + styled-system and wanted try to to use theme-ui and go a little more ~custom~… Quickly moved away from this! Too much overhead for me in using any component-based system and went with tailwindcss. I think people shy away from class-based CSS tooling like this because the HTML markup itself looks messy, but I think that is a fear that comes from the anxiety about maintainability if _you are writing the CSS_. I know that I don't have to maintain the CSS behind the classes and if I'm using them as prescribed, I'm golden.
